    "Before you start training your model, it's important to understand a few key aspects of your dataset:\n",
    "- **What is the unit of observation?**\n",
    "    In other words, what does each row in your dataset represent? For example, is each row a user, a state, a product, or a type of loan? Understanding this will help you interpret your results correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **What is the dimension of the dataset?**\n",
    "    How many rows (observations) and columns (variables/features) are there? This gives you a sense of the size and complexity of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the response variable (also called the target variable)?**\n",
    "    This is the variable you are trying to predict or understand. If there is a response variable, you will likely be using supervised learning techniques. If there isn’t a clear response variable, then unsupervised learning methods (like clustering or dimensionality reduction) may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hint: Ask yourself if a decimal value makes sense as a possible output for the model. If yes it makes sense (e.g., $2.50, 2.5 hours, 2.5 feet), then your response variable is likely numeric, and you are dealing with a regression problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If not (e.g., halfway between “red” and “blue” doesn’t make sense), then your response variable is categorical, and you are likely working on a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do the independent variables (also called features, predictors, or covariates) relate to the response variable?**\n",
    "    Understanding this relationship, through data exploration and visualizations, can help you choose the right model and improve your model's performance. Do some variables seem to have a strong connection to the outcome? Are there patterns or trends? Is there a non-linear relationship between any of the independent variables and the response variable?"

    "Understanding what each row means in your dataset is really important for modeling. For instance, if you have a dataset that contains loan delinquency data that is aggregated by state and year but you want to build a predictive model about predicting individual loan deliquencies, then you might be in trouble. To go more in detail, if your model is trained using state aggregated data, it was not trained with data that have the same level of detail as what you want it to do (example: your training data can have a column called total number of below living below the poverty line in a state, but if you want your model to predict the likelihood of delinqency for 1 person, you don't have the total number of below living below the poverty line). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask, so can create a model that predicts the deliquency rate for a given state at a given year? Yes! In this case, the row guanarlarity matches up (each row in your data is a state at a given year and you want to predict a state at a given year). **Note** If you are doing a time series model (is a dataset where time is a key feature and the order of the data matters such as monthly sales revenue, stock prices), be sure to careful during the train test split phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum this section all up, it is really crucial to understand what each row means and make sure it matched with what you want your model to predict. So, you might ask, how do I figure that out?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the dataframe and figure out what is unique about each row. In this case, we can see that each row seems to be a unique individual, so I can create some kind of model to predict loan delinquency for an individual. "
