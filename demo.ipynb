    "### Reading Data and Understanding Your Dataset\n",

    "Before you start working on the model training, it is important to understand the following things about your dataset:\n",
    "- What is the unit of observation? AKA What is each row? (Is each row a user? Is each row a state? Is each row a type of loan? )\n",
    "- What is the dimension of the dataset (how many rows and columns are there)?\n",
    "- What is my response variable? If there is a response variable (AKA I should consider supervised learning models), is the response variable categorical or numeric? If there does not exist a response variable, I should think about unsupervised models.\n",
    "    - Hint: If the model outputs a decimal number (eg. 2.5) does that make sense as a value for the response variable? If a decimal value makes sense (eg. $2.50, 2.5 feet, 2.5 hours, etc), then the response variable is likely a numeric value. If a decimal value does not make sense (eg. half way between red and blue), then the response is categorical.\n",
    "- How does the independent variables/features/covariates (all different names meaning the same thing) correlate with the response variable?"
